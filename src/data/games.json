Though it had a very rough launch due to its release in a buggy state, over time it became a tech showcase for showing off all the newest graphics technology. Under the buggy mess, Cyberpunk had solid FPS and RPG gameplay. The game had really aesthetically pleasing character models. Among them, Judy, Panam, Johnny, etc. won the hearts of the players. Now to mention the elephant in the room: Night City. NC is truly one of the most beautiful virtual places I have seen. From neon-lit roads to the brightly illuminated skyline at night, everything looks breathtaking. After playing the game, it felt as if the city was the main character."
